Count all possible paths from top left to bottom right of a mXn matrix
//The problem is to count all the possible paths from top left to bottom right of a mXn matrix with the constraints that from each cell you can either move only to right or down
//Complexity of below is Exponential 
/ number n from the topmost leftmost cell (cell at 1, 1)
int  numberOfPaths(int m, int n)
{
   // If either given row number is first or given column number is first
   if (m == 1 || n == 1)
        return 1;
 
   // If diagonal movements are allowed then the last addition
   // is required.
   return  numberOfPaths(m-1, n) + numberOfPaths(m, n-1);
           // + numberOfPaths(m-1,n-1);
}
 
 
 
 //DP Solution  Complexity is O(mn)
 // Returns count of possible paths to reach cell at row number m and column
// number n from the topmost leftmost cell (cell at 1, 1)
int numberOfPaths(int m, int n)
{
    // Create a 2D table to store results of subproblems
    int count[m][n];
 
    // Count of paths to reach any cell in first column is 1
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
        count[i][0] = 1;
 
    // Count of paths to reach any cell in first column is 1
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        count[0][j] = 1;
 
    // Calculate count of paths for other cells in bottom-up manner using
    // the recursive solution
    for (int i = 1; i < m; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++)
 
            // By uncommenting the last part the code calculatest he total
            // possible paths if the diagonal Movements are allowed
            count[i][j] = count[i-1][j] + count[i][j-1]; //+ count[i-1][j-1];
